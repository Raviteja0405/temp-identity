# Identity Management DApp

This is a decentralized application (DApp) for managing user identities on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register, update, and retrieve identity information using their Ethereum address.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register their identity by providing their name, email, phone number, and Ethereum address.
- **Identity Retrieval**: Users can retrieve their identity information using their Ethereum address.
- **Identity Update**: Users can update their registered identity information.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict certain actions to authorized users only.
- **Event Logging**: Track registrations and updates on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Node.js
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- Truffle (for smart contract management)
- MetaMask (for secure transaction signing)
- Flask
- web3.py

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/identity-management-dapp.git
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Compile and migrate smart contracts:

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

5. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6. Start the React front-end:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

2. Fill in your updated information and Ethereum address.
3. Click the "Update" button to submit the changes.

## Development

### File Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `contracts/`: Directory containing Solidity contracts.
- `src/`: React front-end source files.
- `migrations/`: Truffle migration files.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file.
- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

### Deployment

To deploy the application, follow the usual Flask and React deployment procedures. You may also need to deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
